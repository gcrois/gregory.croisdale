# LangJam GameJam 2025: Day 2

This, I hope, will be my laziest post of the series.

I made the language on the train today! It's fun to play with in text, excited to hook it up to my GUI.

I'm working on making classic Excel selections, like A1:B2, synthesize to an array of cell references. That way, it should be very easy to write formulas that operate over ranges of cells -- and finally make the game of life.

I wasted a _ton_ of time today trying to get Bevy to run in a worker thread. It looks like it isn't working except the WebGPU backend, which my daily-driver browser doesn't support.

I think I might abadon Bevy and just use egui. It should help a lot with text input, too.

I leave Germany tomorrow, so we shall see how plane days compare to train days.

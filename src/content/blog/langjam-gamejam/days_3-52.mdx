# LangJam GameJam 2025: Days 3 - 52

"This, I hope, will be my laziest post of the series."
- Me, [50 days before never working on the project again](/blog/langjam-gamejam/day_2)

The plane days were certainly worse than the train days... and things have been incredibly busy with work... and maybe I just lack gumption --- but I missed the LangJam GameJam deadline.

But, I miss this project! So I want to go ahead and finish it anyways.

### Random Infinite Canvas GUI

I got bored (and nostalgic for [DeckFlow](https://deckflow.org/) today), so I built an infinite canvas in Rust that I want to hook up to SheetLang.

Time will tell if it ever happens...

### SheetLang Improvements

I also added numpy-style array slicing to SheetLang. It needs a GUI, but is fun to play with in my brain.

I've also been obsessed with Tofu and IoC lately (shoutout https://unhexium.net/!), so I've replaced much of my personal project deployments with [fancy, more repeatable workflows](https://github.com/gcrois/sheetlang/blob/main/infra/main.tofu).
